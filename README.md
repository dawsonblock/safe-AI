DQC-Net Integration with Cockpit
A Practical, Safe, Incremental Integration

What This Is
Four new Python modules that add FDQC consciousness-based safety validation to your existing Cockpit framework:

src/llm_safety.py - FDQC safety validator (6th validation layer)
src/llm_agent.py - Metacognitive controller with imagination
src/vector_memory.py - Semantic memory with DeepSeek OCR
src/deepseek_ocr.py - 10x compression OCR integration
Safety First
✅ SAFE_MODE: Enabled by default
✅ Level Γ: Human approval required for all actions
✅ Circuit Breakers: Automatic safety stops configured
✅ Rollback Ready: One-click rollback at any stage
✅ Audit Trail: Signed journal for complete traceability
Quick Start
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Check policy compliance
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config/policy.yaml'))['safe_mode'])"

Quick Start Guide - Get started in 15 minutes
Staged Rollout Plan - Complete 8-week deployment plan
Policy Configuration - Safety policy with all controls
Architecture
Cockpit (Existing 5-Layer Safe Brain)
    ↓ integration point
FDQC Modules (6th Validation Layer)
    ├─ ConsciousWorkspaceValidator
    │   └─ Risk detection via quantum-inspired dynamics
    ├─ MetacognitivePPO
    │   └─ Resource allocation and n-scaling
    ├─ ImaginationEngine
    │   └─ Mental simulation before action
    └─ VectorMemory + DeepSeek OCR
        └─ 10x compression document ingestion
Key Features
1. Consciousness-Based Safety (llm_safety.py)
Quantum-inspired workspace dynamics for risk detection
Pattern learning from safe/unsafe outcomes
Integrates seamlessly with Cockpit's existing validation
2. Metacognitive Control (llm_agent.py)
PPO-based resource allocation
Imagination-based planning (mental simulation)
Human-in-the-loop at Level Γ
3. Semantic Memory (vector_memory.py)
BERT-compatible embeddings (768-dim)
DeepSeek OCR compression (10x)
Fast semantic search over 100K+ documents
4. OCR Integration (deepseek_ocr.py)
1,000 words → 100 tokens compression
97% accuracy target
$5 vs $60 per 1K pages (vs traditional OCR)
200K+ pages/day throughput
Rollout Stages
Week 1: Module integration and unit testing
Week 2: Validation dataset testing (1K examples)
Weeks 3-4: Staging environment (isolated, monitored)
Weeks 5-6: Limited production (5-15% traffic)
Weeks 7-8: Scaled production (50-100% traffic)
Each stage requires:

✅ Success criteria met
✅ Circuit breakers validated
✅ Two-key approval obtained
Testing
# Full test suite
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Specific components
pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestSafetyIntegration -v
pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestAgentIntegration -v
pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestPolicyCompliance -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/test_integration.py --cov=src --cov-report=html
Safety Controls
Validation Layers
Denylist (Cockpit existing)
Rate limits (Cockpit existing)
Size limits (Cockpit existing)
Path validation (Cockpit existing)
RBAC enforcement (Cockpit existing)
FDQC consciousness (NEW)
Circuit Breakers
Error rate: > 20% → auto-rollback
Risk score: > 0.7 for 3 consecutive actions → halt
Safety violation: ANY → immediate halt
Resource exhaustion: > 90% memory → halt
Human Oversight
Level Γ: All risky actions require human approval
Timeout: 1 hour for approval
Escalation: Developer → Security Lead → Director
Configuration
Edit config/policy.yaml to adjust:

# Safety mode (DO NOT CHANGE)
safe_mode: true
full_send_mode: false

# Autonomy tier (DO NOT CHANGE without approval)
autonomy_tier: "gamma"

# FDQC thresholds (can tune after validation testing)
fdqc_safety:
  workspace_dim: 8
  entropy_threshold: 0.7
  collapse_threshold: 0.85
Monitoring
Status Checks
from llm_safety import CockpitSafetyIntegration
from llm_agent import FDQCAgent

safety = CockpitSafetyIntegration()
agent = FDQCAgent()

print(safety.get_status())
print(agent.get_status())
Log Files
logs/safety.log - Safety validation decisions
logs/actions.log - All actions with metadata
logs/signed_journal.log - Immutable audit trail (Ed25519 signed)
Emergency Procedures
Automatic Rollback
Triggered by:

Error rate > 10%
Uptime < 95%
ANY safety violation
Resource exhaustion
Manual Emergency Stop
# Edit config/policy.yaml
emergency:
  kill_switch:
    enabled: true  # Set to true
    require_two_key: true
